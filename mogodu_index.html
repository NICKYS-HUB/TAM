	 <strong>Mogodu Monday</strong> , A weekly occasion wherein many
         make a celebration of the most unpopular day of the week, Mogodu Mondays

         great food with friends and family at their local cafés,
         restaurants, and shisanyama spots.</p>

        <p>After realising how different entrepreneurs failed as businesses were
        collapsed by Covid-19 lockdown impacts, some South African entrepreneurs
        came up with Mogodu Monday idea with the purpose of reviving
        their business. The aim was to have people relax and spend time on
        Monday at their venues from 12pm till late.</p>

        community and providing traditional meals which they all don’t want to see
        fading.Looking back at how <em>great-grandmothers cooked Mogodu</em>  for
        families, we want our guests not only to remember old times but look up

        for diners. Mogodu Monday to bring you the tasteful cuisine served
